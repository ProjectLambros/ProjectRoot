//make a folder name it whatever you want
mkdir gmboybusiness

//cd into folder
cd gmboybusiness

//initialize git to track the folder you creted
git init

//this adds our repoistory the the pull command
git remote add origin https://github.com/ProjectLambros/ProjectRoot.git

// this makes sure that all commit and pushes will be to our repository
git push -u origin master

//pulls all files in Project Lambros
git pull origin master


//if you have done this before and just want to see differences from your version and the one on the web
git diff HEAD

//If you feel like you might be working on the project for a while
// and you dont want to deal with weird git crap
// or if you want to cleanly do your work 
git branch yourbranchname

// switch to the new branch you made man
git checkout yourbranchname

.
.
.
add files and do changes and stuffs
.
.
.

//stage your files to be uploaded
git add <files>

//will store message and get it ready for final push
git commit -m "DIS IS MAH MESSAGE ABOUT THINGS I DID"

//if you branched this is where you merge that stuff
git checkout master
git merge yourbranchname

//check dah log if you need to
git log

//check whats being staged and whats changed and needs to be staged and such
git status

//finally do this after you have added and commited your stuff
git push origin master

//done (I think this is all add changes as neccessary)

//branching makes things a little easier so we all arent pushing and pull on the same branch so less
//errors occur
